# balder
This is a research compendia that describes the incidence of clinically actionable biomarkers found across multiple cancer types. 

## Scope 
This work utilizes lists of clinically actionable cancer biomarkers curated by the Molecular Oncology Almanac (MOA), OncoKB, and CIViC. This work examines the frequency of these biomarkers in data obtained from multiple research studies and publicly available genomic data sets.

## Running this compendia 
Figures and tables are generated by executing R scripts found in the "code" folder. All input data is publically avaible, but may require authorization or is subject to terms of use under the owning body. Additional details on the data used can be found 
[here](code/reports/balder_raw_data_sources.pdf).

## Analysis overview 
The following schematic provides an overview of the central balder operations including data harnonization, annotation, QC, and reporting:
